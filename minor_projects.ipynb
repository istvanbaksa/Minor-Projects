More specifically, if the required letter is the first letter mapped to the key, one key press is needed, if it's the second, two key presses are needed and so on. For instance, if we want to input the word giht, we will press the following keys: g-4 i-444 h-44 t-8. The new possibility Marko discovered enables you to input text more easily because you don't need several presses per letter anymore, just one. The software will try to figure out what word from the dictionary you are trying to input.\n",

That is the reason why he decided to test his hypothesis that the errors are frequent. Marko knows by heart the whole dictionary in the mobile phone. The dictionary consists of N words consisting of lowercase letters from the English alphabet, the total length of the word not exceeding 1000000 characters. He will give an array of key presses S, of total length at most 1000, and wants to know how many words from the dictionary can be mapped to the given array of key presses if the T9 input feature is used.\n",
